	    Hongjoong:
	    <br>"My content's title is 'BY.HONGJOONG'
	    <br>Actually, when I started doing this content at the beginning, I did it because I wanted to introduce some old songs.
	    <br>But it would be great if I can not only show the songs, but also how I make them. I want to show something different through 'BY.HONGJOONG'
	    <br>So I upgraded 'BY.HONGJOONG' widely."
	    <p>In 'BY.HONGJOONG' Hongjoong covers old songs from his favourite idols. He arranges and sings a whole new version himself.
	    <br>The content name says it all: everything is done by Hongjoong himself!
	    <br>Two of his covers contain a 'behind the scenes' clip to show everyone the process behind the making of the cover and the music video.
	    <p>His covers:

	     Seonghwa:
		<br>"My content is 'MARS ASMR'
		<br>It just means I'll make clips that contain sounds of various things.
		<br>I want to make something interesting and funny, or clips of me finding sounds, and let you listen to sounds that make you feel comfortable.
		<br>It's one of my purposes too, so I just hope you can enjoy it."
		<p>In 'MARS ASMR' Seonghwa makes ASMR in an original way. 
		<br>For example: in the first video of this series, he had to complete ASMR-related challenges. His second video was royalty-themed and his third video is office-themed.
		<br>The meaning behind 'MARS ASMR' is simple. 
		<br>ASMR is the content Seonghwa makes and MARS is one of Seonghwa's nickname (his name backwards, Hwaseong, means 'Mars' in Korea)
		<br>And to top that all off, MARS has the same letters as ASMR.

		<p>Yunho has already been making 'ANEWZ' videos for a while before they decided to make individual content, so he just decided to continue with it!
		<br>ANEWZ is basically a news program in which Yunho shares some TMI about the members or other interesting things such as future plans for the group.
		<br>Now, Yunho has started to interview members as well and include the members more in 'ANEWZ'

	<h4 class="neroinfo">
		ATEEZ covered TURBO's 'Black Cat Nero' and performed with this song at 'Immortal Songs' (am important Korean singing contest).
		<br>Fun fact: they actually won!
		<br>Just like Hongjoong rearranges and covers songs, the whole group did the same for this song.
		<br>The fans liked it so much that on Halloween, they released a MV (music video) for their cover on their channel which is Halloween-themed.
		<br>This cover is one of the most iconic covers ATEEZ has ever done and I have to admit that the performance and the video were both outstanding!
